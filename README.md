First project derived from the application "Google Photos" using Spring Boot.

Users are able to Upload a Photo/GIF to the database and Download the content locally.

Learning Opportunities:
- Learnt about Spring's Dependency Injection
- Learn about MVC Frameworks (Used to control how information is represented internally versus how it is presented to the other user)
- Learnt about validation and file handling
- Spring data and Databases (brief introduction to db. in order to store photos)
- Learnt how to deploy the application

What I need to improve on:
- Documentation --> Uilising Swagger
- Depth of .db and configurations
- Understanding @GetMapping, @RestController and what they are able to do. (Controller functions)
- The process/logic of Validation
- Understanding Dependency Injection
